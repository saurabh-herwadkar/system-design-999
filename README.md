# System design 999

## Context

- This document is my take on concepts around system design
- This is in no ways a doucment only meant for interview purposes
- Aim is to educate budding engineers and wannabe architects on concepts around system design



# Abstract concepts

# Distributed systems

Contrary to the previous concept of having all components on a single machine and probably in a monolith
Distributed systems by default will have their components on seperate instances.
Components like UI, Compute and persistence will be on seperate logical instances

**A** few key features are

- In modern achitectures (Post 2020) by default your system will be distributed
- Communication betwweh these components will be mainly using HTTP(s) though  other protocls may apply
- This surely increase the complexity of the system overall
- This reduces the total points of failure and mitigates against a single point of failure (SPF)
  


# UI / UX


# Back end and compute


# Persistence

# Agile
